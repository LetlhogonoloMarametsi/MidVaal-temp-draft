                  <h4><em>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</em></h4>
                  <p>Midvaal Water Company was established in August 1954 as a Pty Ltd. under the name of Western Transvaal Regional Water Company charged with meeting the water requirements of the local gold mines and then Stilfontein Health Committee in the KOSH region.

                    Capital to build the infrastructure of the purification plant was raised by way of a loan obtained from Anglo American Corporation in the sum of US $ 2 million.  The loan was repaid out of the funds generated by water sales. GENCOR was the biggest consumer at the time and they were appointed under contract as managers, technical experts and secretaries for the Company.
                    
                    The original design capacity of the purification plant was 56 ML/day.  To meet the additional requirements of Klerksdorp the capacity of the plant was increased to 85 ML/day in 1958.  A pipeline was also installed to supply water to Orkney.  As demand for water increased, the capacity of the plant was again increased in 1962 to 114 ML/day.  The booming mining industry added impetus to increase the demand of water further and finally the capacity of the Company was increased to 320 ML/day.
                    
                    Initially the Company supplied 90% of its production to the mining sector and only 10% to the municipal sector.  Due to decline in mining activity and increase in household consumption, the Company currently supplies 70% water for human consumption through the City of Matlosana and only 30% to the mines still operating in the KOSH region.  The Company is the only bulk supplier of preference and repute in the KOSH region with an excellent and enviable track record.
                    
                    To improve its position as a water services provider, the institutional status of the Company was changed to a Section 21 Company (a Non-Profit Organisation) in 1984.  Furthermore, due to rationalisation of its operations, GENCOR sold its interests in the area of operation of Midvaal Water and cancelled the management contracts it had with the Company in 1997.  The Company operates as an autonomous and independent entity as from that time.
                    
                    In 1998, the name of the Company was changed to Midvaal Water Company to be in line with the current dispensation.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>SIZE OF OPERATIONS AND ASSETS</h4>
                    <p>The Company is a medium sized organisation in the sector and rated at the same level as Magalies Water and Bloem Water.  The value of its assets recorded in the balance sheet is around R1,5 billion and a sizeable amount of investments through internally generated funds.

                  <h4>OWNERSHIP</h4>
                  <p>At the initial incorporation of the Company shares were held by the Mining Companies operating in the region and they represented as the shareholders.  The shares were bought back by the Company and there is no shareholding or ownership interest in the Company.  Therefore, the Company owns itself and all of its resources and assets belong to it.

                    The Company is a non-profit organisation registered under the Companies Act.  It has enjoyed so far tax free status like any other local government organisation.
                    
                    In terms of the provisions of the Companies Act 2008, the income and property of the company shall not be distributable to the company’s incorporators, members, directors, officers or persons related to any of the foregoing. Furthermore, the company shall apply all of its assets and income, however derived, to advance its stated objects, as set out in its Memorandum of Incorporation. Therefore, the funds generated are utilised solely for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing water supply services in the best interest of the communities being served.</p>
                  <br>
                    <h4>GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE</h4>
                  <p>In terms of the Memorandum of Incorporation, the members on the Board of Midvaal Water Company are nominated by its major consumers, who have entered into consumer agreements with the Company for the supply of water.  The Board of the Company is constituted by seven nominated directors (of which four are nominated by City of Matlosana, its Water Services Authority, three board members are nominated by the Mining Sector)  and three fully independent non-executive directors, to enhance the skills set, held by the Board.

                    The Board of Midvaal Water Company has demonstrated its commitment to highest calibre and standards of corporate governance and continues to espouse the principles of fairness, accountability, responsibility, transparency combined with ethical behaviour.  As a result, the Company seeks to improve compliance with the generally accepted accounting and sound corporate governance practices and prides itself in attaining its objectives in this regard.
                    
                     
                    The Board has constituted the following Committees to maintain its oversight on relevant matters:
                    
                    Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Committee
                    Audit and Risk Management Committee
                    Human Resources and Remuneration Committee
                    These Committees have specific Terms of Reference and are assisting the Board to fulfil its oversight and governance responsibilities on matters affecting these committees.  The Terms of Reference of these Committees are reviewed from time to time to align them with legislation and meet any newly identified requirements. The Board has also approved a comprehensive corporate governance policy which has strengthened corporate governance practices and clarified the role of the Board as well as Management and other structures.
                    
                    The governance model of the Company enables the participation of the stakeholders in decision making in the most effective and democratic manner and is one of the most representative structures in the Country.</p>
